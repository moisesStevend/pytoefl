# pytoefl
Simulate toefl independent speaking test on python script. I built this because practicing TOEFL speaking, while recording, and measuring time spent at the same time, is not possible.
This script will save your voice recording in form of wav file.

# How it works
Run the script, and follow the prompt. Your response will be recorded in form of wav file.
